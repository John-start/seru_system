# Seru Scheduling Optimization with Interval Grey Numbers

## Overview
This repository contains the code and datasets used in the study on single-period static seru scheduling problems under uncertainty. The study introduces interval grey numbers to represent the processing time of individual products and proposes a novel comparison method for grey numbers. An enhanced Genetic Algorithm with a Neighborhood Search strategy (GA-NS) is developed to solve the seru scheduling problem, which considers the uncertainty of processing times. This repository provides the implementations of both the traditional Genetic Algorithm (GA) and the enhanced GA-NS algorithm, along with numerical experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of these algorithms.
